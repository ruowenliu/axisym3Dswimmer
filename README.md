**This repository stores the programs for the preprint**

_Shape optimization of slip-driven axisymmetric microswimmers_ [arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00656/)

**It contains the following parts**
1. Problem solver (kernals, ect.)

The _solver_ folder contains the programs for solving the forward (and adjoint) problem. 

Some despcription of the programs are listed below.
