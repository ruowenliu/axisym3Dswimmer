# axisym3Dswimmer

## This repository stores the programs for the preprint:

_Shape optimization of slip-driven axisymmetric microswimmers_ [arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00656/)

## This repository contains the following parts
1. Problem solver (kernals, ect.)

   The _solver_ folder contains the programs for solving the forward (and adjoint) problem. 

   Some despcription of the programs are listed below.
   
   _brewermap_ (c) 2014 Stephen Cobeldick is used to control colorbars.

2. Calculation of maximum efficiency on prolate spheroids with various reduced volumes

   **To run the program, use runProlateSpheroid.m**

3. Parametrization of shapes

   **To run the program, use xxxx.m**

4. Shape sensitivity verifications

   **To run the program, go to the folder "verify_sensitivity", then run "sens_verify_main.m". It reproduces the main results in Table 4.1, Section 5.1.**

5. Optimization algorithms

   **To run the program, use xxxx.m**
